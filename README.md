# Craig's Gist

### Welcome to the Craig's Gist GitHub repository! 

The purpose of this website is to give me "internet landlord" status. By that I mean I will have a space that is completely ruled by me.
I can do whatever I want with this space from changing any styles to uploading my own content. I will be completely free from the restrictions of
the modern internet. There will be no Google/Facebook bloatware and no excessive JavaScript crap.

## Site Overview

Craig's gist will have a simple-to-use structure consisting of a top bar that will take the user to the main sections of the website.

### Homepage

Links to all the other sections. Make this dynamic based on the most recent updated section?
